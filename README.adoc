Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with Python

=== Provisioning Python Resources

Each of the applications in the Python family include configuration properties that specify Python(Jython) script
location and directory path. These properties use Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Resource] abstraction.
Python script and directory locations may reference a local file or URL resource (e.g. http). Classpath resources are
intentionally not supported as it would require a Python developer to package Python scripts in the jar. Scripts may
be optionally downloaded from a git repository. If you provide a valid `git.uri` to the repository, the application will clone the repository
to the local file system during initialization and load scripts from there.
