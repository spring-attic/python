Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with Python

## Accessing Python Resources

Each of these applications in the Python family include configuration properties that specify Python script locations and directories. These properties use Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/resources.html[Resource] abstraction.  Python script and directory locations reference to a local file  or URL resources (e.g. http). 

Classpath resources are intentionally not supported as it would require a Python developer to package Pyhton scripts in the jar. 
If you provide a `git.url` to a repository, the application will clone the repository to the local file system during initialization and load scripts from there. 


## Python via Http

These applications provide a simple way to integrate with an external Python application exposed as an http service.
This will technically work with any http service. It is a specialized implementation of the
https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/httpclient[httpclient]
processor that provides support for local execution of a Python wrapper script via an embedded Jython ScriptEngine to
transform data in and out of the http server.

## Jython Processor

# Python Local Process

These applications install and run an external Python application in the local container.

## Prerequisites

These applications install and run an external Python application in the local container. These applications typically 
import https://pypi.python.org/pypi/springcloudstream[springcloudstream] to handle low level I/O. Simply provide a
single argument Function that returns a value. Both the argument and return value must be `str` types.

For example

```python
from springcloudstream.stream import Processor

def echo(data):
    return data


process = Processor()
process.start(echo)
```

The application requires that Python (2.7 or 3) is installed along with Java in the local container or server.

* Standalone - Install Python per instructions for your OS.
* CloudFoundry - Use the https://github.com/dturanski/java-python-buildpack[java-python-buildpack].
* Docker - Use one of the of the java-python images https://hub.docker.com/u/korekontrol/[here],

If the Python app is pulled from Git at runtime, the Java application will invoke `pip` to install any dependencies
listed in `requirements.txt`. If using the Java Python Buildpack, the buildpack will handle this.
In either case, include the line
```
springcloudstream>=1.0
```
