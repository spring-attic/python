## Java Python Buildpack



You can download a Spring Cloud Stream Python App binary (e.g., with Rabbit or Kafka Binder) in the root directory of a
Python app, and push it using the {java-python-buildpack}[Java Python buildpack]. This build pack extends the
{python-buildpack}[Python buildpack] to support the deployment of a full Python app in the container. The Spring
Cloud Stream App will be started and willlaunch a local Python process
or run a packaged script using an embedded Jython ScriptEngine, depending on the configuration. For example. Suppose
you have a directory containing:

```
myapp.py
requirements.txt
python-local-processor-rabbit-1.2.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

You can:

```
$ cf push -b  https://github.com/dturanski/java-python-buildpack
```

Or for use with Spring Cloud Data Flow Cloud Foundry Server, you can zip the directory and register the zip file as
processor. You must also specify the Java Python buildpack as a deployment property

```
$ zip ../myapp.zip -r *
```
