Spring Cloud Stream App Starters for integrating with python

This application invokes a REST service, similar to the standard {httpclient-processor}[httpclient processor]. In fact,
this application embeds the {httpclient-processor}[httpclient processor]. As a convenience for Python developers, this
allows you to provide a Jython wrapper script that may execute a function before and after REST call in order to
perform any necessary data transformation. If you don't require any custom transformations, just use the
{httpclient-processor}[httpclient processor].

The diagram shows input and output adapters as conceptual components. These are actually implemented as
functions defined in a single script that must conform to a simple convention:

```python
def input():
    return "Pre" + payload;

def output():
    return payload + "Post";

result = locals()[channel]()
```

The function names `input` and `output` map to the conventional channel names used by Spring Cloud Stream processors.
The last line is a bit of Python reflection magic to invoke a function by its name, given by the bound variable
`channel`. Implemented with Spring Integration Scripting, `headers` and `payload` are always bound to the Message
headers and payload respectively. The payload on the `input` side is the object you use to build the REST request.
The `output` side transforms the response. If you don't need any additional processing on one side, implement the
function  with  `pass` as the body:

```python
def output():
   pass
```

[NOTE]
====
The last line in the script must be an assignment statement. The variable name doesn't matter. This is required to bind the return value correctly.
====

[NOTE]
====
The script is evaluated for every message. This tends to create a a lot of classes for each execution which puts
stress on the JRE `Metaspace` memory region (or `Permgen` if using
a JRE prior to version 8). In Java 8, Metaspace is unlimited by default, allocated from native memory, and therefore
limited by the native OS. If deploying to CloudFoundry, the Java Buildpack Memory Calculator sets `-XXMaxMetaspaceSize`.
(see https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-memory-calculator for details). If using JBP v4.x, you may
override the calculated value (and others) by specifying `-XXMaxMetaspaceSize` explicitly in `JAVA_OPTS`. You also
need to increase the container memory accordingly. Similar tuning is advised in any containerized environment.

== Options

The **$$python-http$$** $$processor$$ has the following options:

//tag::configuration-properties[]
$$git.basedir$$:: $$The base directory where the repository should be cloned. If not specified, a temporary directory will be
 created.$$ *($$File$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$git.clone-on-start$$:: $$Flag to indicate that the repository should be cloned on startup (not on demand).
 Generally leads to slower startup but faster first query.$$ *($$Boolean$$, default: `$$true$$`)*
$$git.label$$:: $$The label or branch to clone.$$ *($$String$$, default: `$$master$$`)*
$$git.passphrase$$:: $$The passphrase for the remote repository.$$ *($$String$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$git.password$$:: $$The password for the remote repository.$$ *($$String$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$git.timeout$$:: $$Timeout (in seconds) for obtaining HTTP or SSH connection (if applicable). Default
 5 seconds.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `$$5$$`)*
$$git.uri$$:: $$The URI of the remote repository.$$ *($$String$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$git.username$$:: $$The username for the remote repository.$$ *($$String$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$httpclient.body$$:: $$The (static) request body; if neither this nor bodyExpression is provided, the payload will be used.$$ *($$Object$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$httpclient.body-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression to derive the request body from the incoming message.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$httpclient.expected-response-type$$:: $$The type used to interpret the response.$$ *($$java.lang.Class<?>$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$httpclient.headers-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression used to derive the http headers map to use.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$httpclient.http-method$$:: $$The kind of http method to use.$$ *($$HttpMethod$$, default: `$$<none>$$`, possible values: `GET`,`HEAD`,`POST`,`PUT`,`PATCH`,`DELETE`,`OPTIONS`,`TRACE`)*
$$httpclient.reply-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression used to compute the final result, applied against the whole http response.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$body$$`)*
$$httpclient.url-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression against incoming message to determine the URL to use.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
